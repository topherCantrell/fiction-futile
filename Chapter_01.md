Chapter 1

Ladies and Gentlemen, how can one man accidentally destroy a million worlds? I had help. Those countless deaths are ultimately on my shoulders, but many other people share the blame, as you will see. Please hear my story and heed my warning. I do not want to add your deaths to my growing list.
Blame my college professors for teaching me to be a computer genius. Without their teaching, I could never have developed such a perfect computer virus. Blame my college roommate for doubting my programming ability, and blame him for daring me to put my virus on a lab computer. I remember sitting in Dean Ray’s office the next week trying to deny my involvement.

“Your virus has single-handedly crippled every computer system on campus.”

“But I didn’t do it.”

“Grades and student records – all gone. You were lucky our network administrator disconnected us from the Internet in time. Who knows what damage you might have been liable for had that virus escaped. As it is, we are shutting down the entire campus for a month to clean up the mess. Do you have any idea how much trouble you have created here? You are lucky we are only kicking you out of school.”

“I tell you, Dean, I didn’t do it.”

Dean Ray reached in his desk, pulled out a laptop computer, and handed it to me.

“Do you recognize this machine, Henry?”

It was my dorm computer. As the Dean took it back and turned it on, it dawned on me; my roommate must have ratted me out. I wonder how much reward he got.

“This is your computer, and here is the source file for a virus program – you wrote this code, didn’t you? It has your name proudly in the comments.”

I just sat there planning my ex-roommate’s death.

“Let’s run the code, shall we?” he asked adding sarcastically “I hope you don’t have anything important here …”

He started my virus and turned the screen to me. The screen cleared as the virus did its magic. 

The virus had the simplest of goals: take over the computer and spread to other systems. I waited in silence knowing what was going on behind the blank screen. The virus probed the hardware determining how to use the computer’s resources. Then it tried spreading through all inter-connections. Finally, it wiped the computer clean.

The dorm computer was not very sophisticated, and it put up no fight for the world’s smartest computer virus. It took only a few seconds for the virus to confiscate the machine, and then it printed its call sign on the screen in bold, black letters.

I sat there, Ladies and Gentlemen, staring at those three words. I used to be proud of the message – the signature of my own handiwork. Now that phrase sends chills down my spine.

	

How about blaming that cab driver for knowing a short cut through traffic? If he hadn’t gotten me to my sister’s office twenty minutes before our dinner date, the virus would never have gotten out.

“Just make yourself at home, Henry. I’ve got to go to a meeting before we eat.” What she meant was that I would have to wait for my lecture on getting into another school. It would be followed up with a lecture on being more responsible. It was the same old lecture she had given me all my life.

I spent the time surfing the Internet on her office computer. I browsed through her company’s standard advertising pages. The standard animation included a black satellite circling a green globe. The faces of several wireless phone customers appeared – laughing and talking.

As the ad continued, a spider wearing the company logo spun a red web over the entire surface of the planet. The company was one of the top contributors to the growth of the Internet turning their satellites from voice carriers to data carriers.

Blame our society for getting so tangled up in technology. Very few people on the planet had a firm grasp of exactly how things worked, yet we had become so dependent on the Internet that everyday life revolved around online services. When you think about it, people had willingly given up their lives to the Internet and thus they had asked to be slaves of my virus. Right?

I sat there watching the advertisement for the company products. Phones and computers had become smaller and smaller until they were actually implanted directly into the brain. People could surf the web with their thoughts instead of their computers. I watched a beautiful lady in the ad lift her eyes and smile as a bubble appeared above her head. Her message to her lover appeared in the bubble, and then his face appeared as the thought-originated email arrived in his brain. There they both sat, smiling. How sickening could it get?

Much sicker. The company enhanced the brain-extension technology with an entire line of artificial eyes and ears. People were actually choosing to have their own body parts removed to get newer models with better performance. A hyper-link appeared on the ad. Just click here to get in line at the company-acquired hospital for extension surgery. The waiting list was a month long. 

Finally, the ad closed with a description of future products being beta tested within the company. Is your IQ lower than you would like? The LaGracor Corporation will soon offer brain extensions to boost your mental capacity. Do you have trouble concentrating? Do you lack the proper self-determination and motivation to succeed in your career? You could get ahead in life if only you could set your mind to it? Soon you will be able to set your mind firmly to it – whatever “it” is – with our new MOTIVATOR product. Simply program in the goals you want to focus on, and the MOTIVATOR in your brain will keep your subconscious driving to completion. 

I tell you Ladies and Gentlemen; it was a fire waiting to happen. I just happened to be the unlucky one who dropped the match. And I dropped the match that very afternoon in my sister’s office.

I closed the ad and marveled at her office computer. It was a state-of-the art machine unlike any I had ever seen. If ever there was a challenge for my virus, this was it. I logged into my home computer and pulled the virus down. I remember the surge of adrenaline as I pressed enter. It sickens me now. I had no way of knowing that that very moment marked the beginning of the end of life as I had known it.

The machine whirled normally for a moment. Then the screen went black. Then those three words, that infamous phrase that will haunt me the rest of my life, flashed before my eyes. I quickly turned off the computer before the virus could spread and sat down on the desk smiling to myself. Pride, Ladies and Gentlemen. I was proud of the monster I had created. I was still smiling when my sister opened the door and waved me out. 

“Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s get out of here – I’m starved!”

Whenever my sister gave me an extra good talk, she always took me to the Coleman House – a very exclusive restaurant near our mom’s home. We sat there over salads oblivious to the destruction taking place back at her office. I tell you Ladies and Gentlemen, the clown that designed the network security for my sister’s company should get most of the blame. No computer virus, not even the world’s greatest virus, should have been able to spread like mine did.

“Martha, are you OK? You seem preoccupied.”

“Not really. Just motivated. I was thinking over some advertising strategies our team is presenting next week to the vice president.”

“Don’t you ever stop working? You look tired. Does that motivator in your head keep you from sleeping?”

“I sleep fine, Henry.” She glared defensively. “And how about you? Perhaps you could use a little motivation, huh? Get into another school and buckle down – use your talents for good this time?”

“Ah. I was hoping you were going to save the speech for dessert.”

“Putting it off till later. That’s always been your answer. You are so bright, and …”

My sister turned her head with a puzzled look.

“What is it?”

“I don’t know.” She spoke now in slow, soft tones. “I have my computer desktop forwarded to my brain extension when I am out of the office. Everything is frozen – no stock reports, no … wait a second. No, I can’t reach anything in the company at all.”

“It’s probably just a temporary glitch in the lines. Don’t worry, your umbilical cord will be back up soon!”

But I found out soon enough that it wasn’t a glitch. My virus had just broken through the security system and taken over the five thousand some-odd computers that comprised the company network. In a matter of minutes, the company was paralyzed as the virus figured out how to use the equipment to spread itself. The virus tried the standard routers to the Internet but found the global network security much tighter.

The virus found the company databases and neural-nets and expert-systems: the largest store house of brain-extension technology on the planet. But the knowledge meant nothing to the dumb virus; it was simply learning how to use whatever hardware it found trying to infect the rest of the world.

It tried all of the computers on the company network until it encountered one very strange computer. It had no way of knowing that the computer was really a motivational implant inside the brain of an engineer working late night in the lab. It spent a few minutes learning the technology, and then the engineer and everyone else in the building with a motivator received a new programmed goal.

Those poor unsuspecting people! They had placed motivators inside their brains and connected their minds to the Internet to advance their careers. But instead of being enslaved by their work, they became enslaved by the goals of a computer virus. They were still normal men and women, but their sense of right and wrong had become muddled by the artificial drive to spread a computer virus. It suddenly became their life’s work.

The president of the company called a special meeting that very night. He ripped down old charts in the war room and focused the team leaders on one problem – how to infest the entire world with the virus. There were lots of ideas presented, and no one gave a second thought to “why” they were doing what they were doing. My virus was the “why”; they were just supplying the “how”. 

Their first action was to purge the virus from the company computers. The network would soon go into overtime as engineers, artificially motivated, designed better and better brain extensions, which would in turn spread the motivation.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I remember the very moment the company computer came back online. I remember the very instant the recall went out to everyone on the Internet who owned a motivator. We were still sitting in the restaurant barely an hour after the network had gone down. My sister, along with all the other victims, received a new priority in life. She quickly stood from the table, dropped her napkin, and glared at me with fire in her eyes. And then she cut through my heart by uttering that three-word phrase – the menacing message I had coded into my computer. The virus had mutated from an executing computer program to an artificial motivation. The message had mutated from printed letters to verbal form.

“Henry Borg, resistance is futile!” She said and stormed out of the restaurant.
