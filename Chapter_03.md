Blame the Gordan home world for not heeding the warning. In the end, the warning sent by the Resistance made it possible for us, the Borg, to escape our planetary confines. Ironic that the Resistance should share the blame...

I accepted an office next to my sister and began working diligently with the motivator design team. Our primary job was to improve Internet access allowing our collective to share thoughts faster and more completely. I tell you Ladies and Gentlemen, I worked harder those three months than ever before and never since.

There were still pockets of what we called resistance, but their numbers were shrinking daily. Their problem was that they couldn’t band together to form a unified plan; as soon as one rebel was assimilated, he would lead the collective straight to the hideouts and arsenals of his cohorts. We had the weapons of the entire planet at our disposal, and we had sheer numbers. We simply waited for terrorists to appear and then assimilated them. We continued to move forward improving the brain implants and the Internet that linked us all together.

In a last-ditch effort, the Resistance seized control of a satellite and turned it to broadcast a message into space.

“A deadly computer virus has infected the people of our planet. Our people are enslaved. Please destroy our devastated world and free our souls.”

Was it curiosity that brought the Gordans to our planet? Were they really bent on trying to help us? They landed in the capitol city of our nation barely a year after the warning was sent into space. Three green ships glistened in the morning sun as the President strolled out to shake hands with the five representatives from the Gordan home world.

A crowd had gathered around the ships pretending to be afraid. A silent signal was given, and the crowd suddenly turned into a silent mob swarming in around the landing party. The Gordan ships opened fire with weapons we had never seen. Blue streaks of energy killed hundreds of drones, but in the end, we abducted the Gordan landing party and raced them to our top research facility.

Then we poured as much of our military firepower on the ships as we could muster. Tanks, planes, bombs, missiles, suicide runs – you name it, we threw it at them. But the Gordan technology was considerable. They slipped above the mayhem and back into orbit largely unscathed.

What happened next was probably the virus’s darkest moment. The entire planet focused on the Gordan physiology. We killed one Gordan in front of his companions and removed his brain. We were going to learn how their brains worked either by exploratory surgery or by direct information – the remaining four Gordans chose to give us the information to avoid dissection. We started work on a motivator that would work on a Gordan.

We accidentally killed two of the remaining Gordans with our modified brain implants. The third suffered enough brain damage to be useless, but the fourth survived and became the first non-Tenmarian to join the collective.

Our new brother gave us a crash course in Gordan technology. Manufacturing around the world turned to the production of advanced weapons and shields – the things we would need to fight the Gordan fleet massing in orbit above us. My team began adding Gordan technology to our implant designs and Internet connections to make a stronger hive.

Ten days after their initial landing, the Gordans were still in orbit looking down on us trying to figure out what to do. They were caught by surprise when we launched two thousand missiles bearing Gordan propulsion and Gordan warheads. With some quick reactions and good concentration, they were able to fend off the attack. We knew they would, but we only needed a diversion. The Gordans were so busy dodging missiles that they didn’t notice the tiny four-man vessel slipping away from Tenmaria. 

The vessel was barely space-worthy, slapped together in a week from specs on a Gordan shuttlecraft. It carried four drones and considerable research/manufacturing facilities and just enough fuel to make one landing at its secret destination. And no one on Tenmaria knew the destination. 

I remember being ever so tired, Ladies and Gentlemen. We all were. The voice in my head that afternoon and the new motivation were nothing less than a call from God to come to Heaven.

“Come here and go to sleep.”  The voice said and kept repeating.

The web browser in my brain became locked on the picture of a Gordan ship sitting in the middle of a grassy field. Hundreds of people lay on the grass in front of the ship. They were all sleeping.

“I think it’s on the farmlands south of the city.” My sister burst into my office.

“That’s what I was thinking. Want me to drive?” I asked.

“Yeah, but we should avoid the toll-way. Everyone else will be going that way. Well, come on … quit wasting time! Let’s go get some sleep!”

And just like that, every person on the planet put down his or her work on the virus and headed for one of the thousand Gordan ships that had landed on Tenmaria. The Gordans had been studying the transmissions on our global Internet, and they used our own network against us. Using the same technique that the virus used to spread motivational tasks to the drones, the Gordans erased the viral motivation and sent out a new command. They established “drone-free” perimeters around their ships and began removing the implants. As people were freed, they joined the cleanup effort. Drones quietly lined up around the ships and went to sleep on the ground. When we woke up, we were left with our own desires – and our own horrible memories.

Our civilization was in ruins, Ladies and Gentlemen. Thousands of people had been killed in spreading my virus. All of our manufacturing facilities had been re-fitted for Borg purposes. We had stolen the Gordan technology, which was now part of us, and the Gordans committed to help us temper the technology with their experience. The uniqueness of our planet – whatever surprises we might have discovered on our own – had been destroyed by my virus. I had destroyed the centuries-developed culture of an entire planet, Ladies and Gentlemen. Can any of you relate to that? There was no punishment for the crime I had committed, but I could no longer live on Tenmaria. The Gordans offered me sanctuary on their home world, and I gladly took it.

A brief demonstration, Ladies and Gentlemen, on the power of geometric progression. Take this penny of Tenmarian currency and put it in your hand. Tomorrow I’ll double the money in your hand to two pennies. The next day, I’ll double it again to four pennies and then eight and so on. At the end of a month, you’ll have a million dollars. The pot starts out small, but as your collection gets larger, it expands rapidly.

So, it was with that tiny Borg seedpod. The Gordans had cataloged thousands of inhabited worlds at various stages of development. The pod had severed its link from the Tenmarian collective shortly after take-off. Then the crew had selected a random, primitive world, and set sail. Nobody on Tenmaria would know where it was going. We knew only that it was out there, and the Gordans began a futile search.

The first primitive world offered no technological resistance for my virus. In fact, the technology was almost too underdeveloped. The virus struggled on the Haltic world for two years just to establish a global Internet and to build modern manufacturing facilities. Then the Borg fleet of twenty ships tackled a slightly more advanced world adding a billion more drones – more work hands and more engineers. Another year crept by, but things began progressing rapidly.

Eight more worlds quickly fell to the Borg virus in the next six months. They all began producing ships and weapons and motivators based on the stolen Gordan technology. Countless engineers turned their efforts to improving on the Gordan technology. By the fifth year, the Borg collective was ten times the size of the Gordan population, and the Borg fleet was twenty times as large as the Gordan armada with weapons and capabilities no Gordan had ever seen.

I watched the news reports when the Borg returned first to Tenmaria. The planet was recaptured that very day. This time the virus employed no trickery. It simply landed on Tenmaria and swallowed the people one by one. There was no struggle, and no negotiating.

The Borg drones had taken on a whole new look. The need for individual thinking had greatly diminished, and the new motivational implants turned the drones into mere puppets of a collective conscious. All individuality was lost. New drones were given prosthetic limbs and senses to enhance their service to the Borg. 

Ladies and Gentlemen, I wasted no time. I borrowed a shuttlecraft from my Gordan hosts while they prepared to fight off the Borg invasion. I tried to tell them they were wasting their time, but they were a stubborn people – I have encountered other, more stubborn people along my midnight ride. Like the Gordans, they too are now Borg. I have spent the past ten years of my life running as fast as I could, getting a better ship where I could, spreading the warning to all who would hear.

So here I am, Ladies and Gentlemen. I stand before you as Father of the Borg. Blame me and curse me if you like, but please believe me; the storm is coming. My demon-child is close on my heels. Gather your loved ones and your belongings and run. Don’t try and fight – just run and spread the warning to all you meet. Warn them that indeed resistance is futile.
