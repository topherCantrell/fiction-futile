“And in the local news, four teenagers staged an elaborate hoax at Northwind Hospital this afternoon. Mike Daniels has the story.”

I propped my feet up on a crate of potato chips and watched the news cast from the basement of my mom’s lake house. Before my dad died, he had turned the summer home into a survival shelter of sorts predicting that the final war was coming. I’m sure he rolled over in his grave when he learned that I started it.

“Thanks Georgia. Several people witnessed what appeared to be an abduction at Northwind this afternoon. Two young boys ran out of the hospital screaming for help. Two doctors followed quickly behind and subdued the boys with anesthesia masks. The doctors then pulled the boys back into the hospital. Police searched the hospital a short time later and discovered four teenage boys, two wearing doctor’s coats, hiding in a janitorial closet. The boys promptly confessed to the hoax and apologized to the disturbed witnesses. No charges have been filed.”

Northwind hospital was the hospital run by my sister’s company. There were other hospitals around the world that performed brain extension implants, but Northwind was the leader. They boasted that they could perform implant surgery in under ten minutes.  At first, the doctors with motivators teamed together to assimilate the remaining doctoral staff. Then the entire hospital staff – all four shifts – was forced into brain surgery. Patients, visitors, anyone who walked into the hospital was quickly enslaved. Ambulances went into overtime abducting people right off the streets. The police investigated eyewitness reports only to be assimilated along with the rest of the local government. News agencies were assimilated, and false stories kept the viral spread under wraps. Entire cities were being enslaved right under the noses of the national governments.

I lived in that basement for a week eating dried foods and drinking bottled water. Surely the federal government would discover the virus and unite with other nations to fight back. I watched the news for any report until Friday night when the President made a special speech to the entire world.

“People of Tenmaria. I am pleased to announce that the Borg computer virus, which devastated our planet over the past week, has now been eliminated. Using a counter-virus on the Internet, we have been able to completely neutralize the motivational implants that have enslaved our people. Many of you have seen loved ones taken by the virus. Most of you have today been freed from your slavery. All of us must carry the horrible memories with us through whatever life we can piece back together; but there is a good lesson to be learned from the pain. We have become too dependent on the Internet, and we have exposed our brains to the whims of technology. We will undo these mistakes in the years to come.

“Local governments have established clean-zones in all major cities. Hospitals that yesterday enslaved us will be working around the clock to remove our implants. Freed individuals will be given an electronic tattoo on the palm like this one that will signify their freedom from the virus. Those without the mark will be arrested and cleansed – we must not allow this horrible week to be repeated. So, I urge you to find the nearest clean-zone as soon as you can. Local directions will be given after this announcement. We have already seen what we as a planet can do if we work together on a common goal. Let us now work together for our common good.”

I was taken in, Ladies and Gentlemen. I bought the lie completely. My own virus had baited me with a devious plan, and I swallowed it hook, line, and sinker. Most of the other freebies bought it too. Only a small percentage of the Tenmarian population escaped that rouse. 

I met up with my sister who stood in line with me at the hospital. She went in first and returned pretending to feel better without the implant. She even pretended to be worried about how the tattoo made her look. I went in for my mandatory scan and came out with a shiny new motivator implant rubbing against the caudate nucleus on the bottom of my brain.
